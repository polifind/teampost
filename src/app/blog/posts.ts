For a decade, Andreessen Horowitz was the darling of tech journalists. The firm threw intimate cocktail parties, gave exclusive quotes, and cultivated relationships with every major reporter in Silicon Valley.

Then, almost overnight, they stopped returning calls.

According to former Verge writer Casey Newton, "I'm leery of any company that thinks regularly talking to journalists is beneath them, and so I've been really disappointed by [a16z's inward turn](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/andreessen-horowitz-silicon-valley-venture-capital-media.php) over the past couple years."

What happened? Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz made a deliberate choice: they decided to go direct.

## In Marc's Own Words

In a recent [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj-EhJzEVPw), Marc Andreessen explained the philosophy directly:

> "We've lived in this world for a while where content only comes from content companies. I think content is going to increasingly come from everybody. We actually hired a reporter at my venture capital firm. We're in the content business. And why do we need a reporter? We need a reporter because the stuff that we do is complicated and new. We think we develop a deep understanding, or at least we try very hard. And then we want to explain these things. And these things are complicated in a world moving fast. And so we're trying to take more responsibility for being able to articulate complex subjects to large audiences. The communications functions in many companies has been trying to get reporters to write the right things. I think increasingly it's direct communication."

That last line is the key: "I think increasingly it's direct communication."

## The Hidden Founder

Most people know a16z was founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. Fewer know about their "hidden founder."

"Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm," one startup founder told [Newcomer](https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-unauthorized-story-of-andreessen). "The power dynamics there is Marc, Ben, and Margit."

Margit Wennmachers joined a16z in 2010 after representing and launching the firm in 2008. She built their communications strategy from scratch, and her influence helps explain why a16z thinks about media so differently than other venture firms.

## From Charm Offensive to Media Empire

Benedict Evans, a16z's former in-house analyst, has mused that "[a16z is a media company that monetizes through VC](https://www.newcomer.co/p/andreessen-horowitz-and-the-future)."

That's not hyperbole. According to reporting from Axios, a16z has built what can only be described as a [media empire](https://www.axios.com/2021/02/13/the-new-media-mogul-andreessen-horowitz). They hired a large editorial team to cover stories about crypto, fintech, and emerging technology. They produce daily podcasts and newsletters. They syndicate content via Substack, YouTube, LinkedIn, and direct email.

The philosophy is simple: own your distribution.

a16z does not depend on media coverage of their announcements. They break news on their own blog and social feeds. The daily repetition, podcast and newsletter every weekday, is designed to algorithmically and habitually favor a16z content. It's an attempt to occupy share of mind continuously.

## The CAA Playbook

Here's what most people miss about a16z's media strategy: it's not new. It's borrowed from Hollywood.

An important part of a16z's origin story is that [they were founded to be "CAA for the tech industry."](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/inside-a16zs-new-media-playbook) When Michael Ovitz founded Creative Artists Agency in 1975, Hollywood was completely controlled by a few dozen big entities who served as gatekeepers to the entertainment industry.

Ovitz built CAA to help creative actors and artists build franchises on their own terms. He forever changed how entertainment worked.

A half century later, a16z sees a similar transition happening in tech. The old guard of legacy capital, legacy media, and legacy distribution can now be sidestepped. Anyone can go viral and gain relevance.

## Why They Turned Their Back on Traditional Media

The firm has largely stopped cooperating with the media, even off the record. Multiple technology reporters have confirmed this shift.

The reasoning, according to those close to the firm: they regard the press as ignorant and unfair. Instead of highlighting the many ways tech is changing lives, journalists fixate on negative stories.

It's better, then, to leave it to those who do understand, like the partners at a16z and their editorial team, to tell those stories directly.

You might disagree with this assessment. Many journalists certainly do. But you can't argue with the results.

## The Results Speak

a16z's assets under management have grown from [$2.7 billion in 2011 to over $42 billion today](https://a16z.com/). Their podcast consistently ranks in the top business shows. Their newsletter reaches hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Their blog posts get shared millions of times.

More importantly, they control their narrative completely. When a16z announces a new fund or investment thesis, they don't need a journalist to validate it. They have their own distribution.

## What This Means for Everyone Else

Here's the uncomfortable truth: if the most powerful venture firm in the world has decided that going direct is the only way to tell their story accurately, what does that mean for everyone else?

It means the companies that figure out how to communicate directly, whether through LinkedIn, newsletters, podcasts, or owned media, will have a massive advantage over those who don't.

It means the founders who can articulate their vision without an intermediary will attract better talent, close bigger deals, and build stronger brands.

It means the era of depending on journalists to tell your story is ending. Not because journalists are bad at their jobs, but because technology has made it possible to reach your audience directly.

## The Lesson

Marc Andreessen didn't build a media empire because he wanted to be a media mogul. He built it because he realized that in the modern world, the ability to communicate directly is a strategic asset.

Every company is a media company now. The only question is whether you're going to act like one.

In December 2025, a [securities filing revealed](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tech-prs-lulu-cheng-meservey-raises-40-million-vc-fund) something unusual: one of tech's most respected communications strategists had raised $40 million for a venture capital fund.

Her name is Lulu Cheng Meservey. And her investment thesis can be summarized in three words: "Storytelling is alpha."

## From Crisis War Room to Board Room

Before we talk about where Lulu is going, we need to understand where she's been.

From October 2022 to January 2024, Meservey served as Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief Communications Officer at Activision Blizzard. She joined during one of the most contentious corporate battles in history: Microsoft's proposed $69 billion acquisition of the gaming giant.

Regulators around the world were skeptical. The FTC sued to block the deal. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority initially rejected it. Sony was lobbying hard against it.

Meservey's job was to shape the narrative. And she did. The deal closed.

Before Activision, she was Vice President of Communications at Substack, where she helped shape the voice of one of the most influential platforms in the creator economy. Even earlier, she co-founded TrailRunner International, a global strategic communications firm.

Today, she sits on the [board of Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/investors/board-of-directors), one of the most important e-commerce companies in the world.

## The Rostra Manifesto

In between all of this, Meservey founded [Rostra](https://rostra.co/), an advisory firm that works with founders on what she calls "founder-led communications."

The Rostra manifesto opens with a quote: "If you want something good, get it from yourself."

The philosophy is direct: founders must craft and tell their own stories, without being dependent on intermediaries. This doesn't mean isolating yourself. It means maintaining narrative control while accepting amplification support.

The manifesto argues that traditional corporate communications have become obsolete. Nothing meaningful, it contends, can be communicated by a faceless committee. The most effective spokesperson is "the person who holds the secret knowledge upon which the enterprise is built."

In other words: the founder.

## Why She Moved From Advising to Investing

When [Axios broke the news](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/07/lulu-cheng-meservey-venture-capital) of her $40 million fund, Meservey explained her thinking simply: "Storytelling is alpha."

She elaborated: "Investing complements Rostra's work because narrative and capital both compound."

Think about that for a moment. Narrative and capital both compound.

The companies that tell their stories well attract better talent, which builds better products, which creates more stories to tell. The companies that stay silent or depend on intermediaries lose ground with every news cycle.

According to the reporting, the fund is structured to invest at the earliest stages, when positioning, messaging, and market trust are still being formed. This is the moment when storytelling matters most, when a founder's ability to articulate their vision can mean the difference between a successful fundraise and a failed one.

## The Competitive Advantage of Going Direct

The Rostra manifesto makes a compelling case: communication skill-building yields competitive advantages in recruiting, fundraising, and sales.

Let's break that down.

**Recruiting**: The best candidates have options. They choose companies with missions they believe in, led by founders they trust. Founders who can communicate directly build that trust faster.

**Fundraising**: Investors are pattern-matching constantly. Founders who can articulate their vision clearly, without needing a PR handler to translate, signal competence and conviction.

**Sales**: Enterprise deals are won by people who can explain complex products simply. Founders who practice direct communication get better at this with every conversation.

Founders willing to communicate directly gain, in Rostra's words, "a massive edge" across all these critical functions.

## The Transition From Gatekeeper to Creator

There's something poetic about Meservey's career arc.

She started as a gatekeeper, helping founders navigate the media landscape and manage their relationships with journalists. She was the intermediary.

Now she's betting $40 million that the intermediary model is obsolete.

The shift reflects a broader change in how information flows. When Meservey started her career, getting coverage in The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times was the gold standard. Founders needed people like her to make those connections.

Today, a founder can post on LinkedIn and reach more of their target audience than a Journal article would. They can start a newsletter and build a direct relationship with customers, investors, and recruits. They can record a podcast and become a thought leader without ever talking to a journalist.

The gatekeepers haven't disappeared. But they're no longer required.

## What Founders Should Take Away

If one of the smartest communications strategists in tech is betting her career on founder-led storytelling, what should founders learn?

**Start now.** Narrative compounds. The earlier you start building your communication skills, the more advantage you'll have.

**Don't outsource your voice.** Agencies and PR firms can amplify your message, but they can't create it. The founder must be the source.

**Think of communication as a core skill, not a nice-to-have.** Just like you'd invest in engineering or sales, invest in your ability to tell your story.

**Go where your audience is.** For most B2B founders, that's LinkedIn. Build there relentlessly.

## The Bottom Line

Lulu Cheng Meservey has seen the future of corporate communications from every angle: as an advisor, as an executive, as a board member, and now as an investor.

Her conclusion? The founders who can tell their own stories will win.

Storytelling is alpha. It's time to start compounding.

    excerpt: "New data shows Americans are spending more time on LinkedIn than ever before. The secret? A 22-year-old policy that every other platform abandoned.",

It isn't just you. A lot of people are spending more time on LinkedIn.

According to a recent [Wall Street Journal analysis](https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/three-reasons-we-cant-get-enough-of-linkedin-31333eff), Americans checking LinkedIn more than once a day climbed to 4.7% last year from 3.9% in 2020. That might sound small, but on a platform with 1.3 billion members, it represents tens of millions of additional daily sessions.

Meanwhile, revenue jumped to $17 billion in 2025 from $7 billion in 2020. Membership doubled. And perhaps most importantly, users actually stick around.

What's happening here?

## The Wasteland Evolved

For years, LinkedIn was a punchline. It was a wasteland of corporate buzzwords, 4 a.m. wake-up routines, and stories about overcoming workplace adversity with a little something called grit.

Some of that remains. But the vibe has shifted.

As content moderation and fact-checking declined at X and Facebook, LinkedIn became a refuge. Many users concluded it was worth trading rage bait for earnest monologues about why getting laid off was a blessing in disguise.

The Journal identified three reasons LinkedIn is winning people over. Each one reveals something important about human psychology and what makes a platform actually work.

## Reason 1: Real Names Create Self-Discipline

Even before Elon Musk gutted X's content moderation, James Bailey was tired of the shouting.

"It's like a cursed artifact that gives you great power to keep up with what's going on, but at the cost of subtly corrupting your soul," the 38-year-old Providence College economics professor told the Journal.

He retreated to LinkedIn. Now he spends five to ten minutes a day on a site he used to ignore.

The reason lies in LinkedIn's oldest and stodgiest rule: real names required.

"I cannot tell you how many times we've had internal debates on: Should we add handles?" said Gyanda Sachdeva, LinkedIn's head of consumer experience. The company stuck with real identities to preserve trust.

The policy works because it makes users more careful. As Sachdeva explained, "They don't want to put something on LinkedIn that a recruiter might look at."

Science backs this up. A [2013 analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212003512) of online newspaper forums found that 53% of anonymous comments contained attacks or vulgarity, compared with just 29% from users who had to identify themselves.

The study's author, Prof. Arthur Santana, concluded that when people can't hide behind an alias, they are much more likely to remain civil.

## Reason 2: Real Names Create Smarter Conversations

The real-name rule doesn't just stop jerks. It also pressures people to perform.

LinkedIn users will be familiar with the saccharine positivity of users explaining how their latest promotion makes them feel "humbled and grateful."

But the need to look professional has a hidden upside: smarter conversations.

Consider a [recent study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3519804) of a stock-investment forum in China. Before requiring registration with government identification, it was a rumor mill. Afterward, the researchers observed that posts about short-term betting declined, replaced by discussions about business fundamentals.

The comments became better at predicting future stock returns.

Even though users didn't have to post under real names, the mere fact that the platform knew who they were improved discourse. As Kanyuan Huang from the Chinese University of Hong Kong explained, accountability changes behavior even when no one is watching.

This appeals to Professor Bailey, who now routinely finds insightful posts on LinkedIn. "It can be a good place for people to share their writing now," he said.

## Reason 3: A Gentler Algorithm

LinkedIn hasn't sat still. To justify Microsoft's 2016 purchase price of $27 billion, the platform evolved from a digital Rolodex into a daily destination.

It overhauled its news feed in 2017 and added TikTok-style vertical videos in early 2024. But the algorithm works differently than other platforms.

According to Sachdeva, the algorithm doesn't promote hot takes. Instead, it emphasizes posts that create "economic opportunity" and get saved or shared.

"It's almost never coming from a place of controversy," she said. "It's usually very constructive."

LinkedIn is even using artificial intelligence to attack a top complaint: the humblebrag from people you don't know. "You don't even know this person and they show up in your feed with humblebrags. We don't want that," Sachdeva said.

But the filter has its limits. If a dad framing his toddler's screamfest as a lesson in conflict resolution is a personal connection of yours, the algorithm might let it through.

"We believe that deserves to be a candidate for your feed," she acknowledged.

## What This Means for Professionals

The data is clear: LinkedIn is where professional attention is going.

While other platforms optimize for engagement through outrage, LinkedIn optimizes for what it calls "economic opportunity." That's a fancy way of saying: content that helps people in their careers.

For professionals trying to build their personal brand, this creates an interesting opportunity.

**The bar for quality is higher.** Anonymous hot takes won't work. Your real name is attached to everything you post.

**But the reward is also higher.** Because the audience is engaged professionally, not just scrolling for entertainment, the people who see your content are more likely to actually matter for your career.

**Consistency compounds.** The algorithm rewards people who show up regularly with valuable content. Unlike platforms where viral moments dominate, LinkedIn rewards steady builders.

## The Irony

There's an irony in LinkedIn's success. The features that made it feel corporate and boring, real names, professional context, earnest positivity, turned out to be exactly what people wanted when every other platform descended into chaos.

Sometimes the old rules are old for a reason.

LinkedIn's 22-year-old real-name policy seemed quaint in an era of anonymous hot takes and viral dunks. Now it looks prescient.

The platform that refused to let you hide is winning because hiding was the problem all along.
